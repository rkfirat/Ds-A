# Sample Questions

1. Implement a member function named ExchangeNode for the LinkedList
    class that accepts two integer parameters, i and j. This function should
    swap the data contained in the i-th and j-th nodes of the linked list. If the
    indices i or j are out of range (e.g., negative values or exceeding the list's
    size), the function must return False to indicate an invalid operation.
    Otherwise, upon successfully swapping the data, it should return True.
    Ensure the function handles edge cases, such as an empty list or when i
    and j refer to the same node.
2. Implement a function named OddCount that takes the root pointer of a
    binary tree as its parameter and calculates the number of nodes whose
    data field contains an odd integer.
3. Write a class named LinkedStack that implements a stack using a linked
    list. You must implement the push and pop functions.
4. Implement a member function named deleteNth for the LinkedList class
    that removes the Nth node from the linked list. For example, if the linked
    list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and n = 2, the modified list should become 1
    -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.
5. Write a C++ program to merge two sorted singly linked lists into a single
    sorted linked list.
